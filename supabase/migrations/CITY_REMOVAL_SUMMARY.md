# City Field Removal Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to remove the city selection from the signup process and profiles table.

## Changes Made

### Database Changes

1. **Removed city_id column from profiles table**
   - Created migration file `20250307_remove_city_id.sql` to remove the city_id column
   - Updated the combined migration file `20250306_fix_signup_issues.sql` to include city_id removal
   - Ensured foreign key constraints are properly dropped before removing the column

2. **Updated Database Functions**
   - Modified `update_user_profile` function to remove the city_id parameter
   - Ensured all database functions work correctly without city_id

### Frontend Changes

1. **Updated Signup Page**
   - Removed the city selection dropdown from the signup form
   - Removed the state management for city selection (selectedCityId and availableCities)
   - Removed the useEffect hook that fetched cities based on country selection
   - Removed the city_id parameter from the update_user_profile call

2. **Simplified User Experience**
   - Users now only need to select a country during signup, making the process simpler
   - Country selection is still required and is handled through the PhoneInput component

## Deployment Instructions

To deploy these changes, follow these steps:

1. **Deploy the SQL Migrations**
   - Option 1: Run the combined migration file `20250306_fix_signup_issues.sql` which includes all changes
   - Option 2: Run the individual migration files in sequence, ending with `20250307_remove_city_id.sql`

2. **Deploy the Frontend Changes**
   - The changes to the signup page have been implemented and should be deployed with your normal deployment process

## Verification

After deploying the changes, verify that:

1. The city_id column has been removed from the profiles table
2. The signup process works correctly without city selection
3. User profiles are created with country_id but without city_id
4. Existing functionality that depends on country selection still works correctly

## Impact on Existing Users

These changes should have minimal impact on existing users:

1. Existing profiles with city_id data will lose that data when the column is dropped
2. The user experience during signup is simplified by removing one step
3. All other functionality related to country selection remains unchanged

## Rollback Plan

If issues are encountered, the following rollback steps can be taken:

1. Restore the city_id column to the profiles table
2. Revert the update_user_profile function to include the city_id parameter
3. Revert the signup page to include city selection

Note that rolling back will not restore any city_id data that was lost when the column was dropped.
